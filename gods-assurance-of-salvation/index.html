<p>Consider 1 John 511-13. Christ came into the world and died to save sinners but many are not able to have the joy of salvation because they lack the assurance that their sins are forgiven and that their names are written in the book of life. Your assurance of salvation is based on the authority of Gods Word not on intellect or emotional feelings. Usually the lack of assurance is a misunderstanding of Gods salvation or the sad result of bad teaching. Third assurance comes through the inward witness of the Holy Spirit.
