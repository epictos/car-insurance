<p><strong>Sterility Assurance Level For Aseptic Processing</strong>, Aseptic filling is subject to a greater contamination risk than terminal sterilisation since the same level of sterility assurance cannot be built into the process. Where bioburden is controlled through aseptic processing terminal sterilization can be applicable at lower lethality levels Classical F time-temperature and radiation dose kGy targets for sterilization processes are arbitrarily selected and intended to simplify process validation but in reality serve to reduce the use of terminal treatments. However it is often claimed that advanced aseptic processing technologies which eliminate or minimise human intervention can achieve contamination rates considerably lower than the usual target rate of 1 in 1000.</p>

With process stable articles the approach often is. This probability is referred to as a sterility assurance level SAL. There are several types of single use systems. Devices purporting to be sterile attain a 106 microbial survivor probability ie assurance of less than 1 chance in 1 million that viable bioburden microorganisms are present in the sterilized article or dosage form. For a healthcare product to be considered sterile the traditional options that have been accessible to a manufacturer are either terminal sterilization to a maximal sterility assurance level SAL of 10 6 or aseptic processing.</p>
